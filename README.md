Introduction
------------

The goal of this project is to help users grow plants. Keeping plants
alive can be a lot of work and we think that technology can help us
with that. We want to create a system that is flexible and extensible,
so that it can be used to water your cactus once a month but also to
produce food for hundreds of people.

Concept
-------

We try to design a modular system. Sensors and Actuators will be
connected to arduinos that serve as an abstraction layer and all the
regulating algorithms run on a PC (like the beagle bone black or
raspberry pi). A shared database will provide information on ideal
environment settings.
